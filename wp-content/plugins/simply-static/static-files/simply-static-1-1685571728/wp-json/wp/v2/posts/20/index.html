The Spanish club will be aiming to lift the trophy for a seventh time while\u00a0<b>Roma\u00a0<\/b>are seeking their first title. The Italians came close to winning the tournament, then called the UEFA Cup, in 1990\/1 only to lose 2-1 on aggregate to compatriots\u00a0<b>Inter<\/b>. Back then, the final was played over two legs, home and away &#8211; that has changed, since 1998 the final has been played as\u00a0<b>a single game<\/b>\u00a0played at a neutral, predetermined venue.<\/p>\n<p class=\"\">The<b>\u00a0old away goals rule<\/b>\u00a0also no longer applies, so tonight there will be\u00a0<b>one winner<\/b>, with no aggregate score and no away goals to tot up.

Out of those, three were decided in extra-time\u00a0<b>five from the penalty spot after 120 minutes<\/b>, and one, famously with a\u00a0<b>Golden Goal<\/b>\u00a0&#8211; the\u00a0<b>nine-goal rollercoaster between Liverpool and Alav\u00e9s<\/b>\u00a0in 2001, which after much toing and froing, was poised at 4-4 with four minutes of extra-time to play and seemingly destined to go on forever. It was one of the last occasions when a match was settled by a golden goal before the rule was abolished for FIFA and UEFA-organised tournaments in 2004.<\/p>\n<div class=\"ext ext-embed\" data-oembed-type=\"twitter\"><\/div>\n<div data-oembed-type=\"twitter\"><iframe id=\"twitter-widget-0\" class=\"\" title=\"Twitter Tweet\" src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/embed\/Tweet.html?creatorScreenName=English_AS&amp;dnt=false&amp;embedId=twitter-widget-0&amp;features=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%3D%3D&amp;frame=false&amp;hideCard=false&amp;hideThread=false&amp;id=1261597509446754309&amp;lang=en&amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Fen.as.com%2Fsoccer%2Fwhat-happens-if-the-two-teams-tie-in-the-europa-league-final-n%2F&amp;sessionId=cebcf212690c5b5b082d8d33aa848c47b81a02e0&amp;siteScreenName=English_AS&amp;theme=light&amp;widgetsVersion=aaf4084522e3a%3A1674595607486&amp;width=550px\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-tweet-id=\"1261597509446754309\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div data-oembed-type=\"twitter\"><\/div>\n<div data-oembed-type=\"twitter\">\n<h3 class=\"\"><b>How does extra-time work in the Europa League final?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p class=\"\">If\u00a0<b>tonight\u2019s final ends level<\/b>\u00a0with both teams tied after the full 90 minutes plus whatever stoppage time match official Anthony Taylor deems fit to add on, two\u00a0<b>15-minute periods of extra-time<\/b>\u00a0will be played with a brief, half-time interval between each half. If\u00a0<b>one of the team scores more goals than the other team<\/b>\u00a0during the 30 minutes of extra time, they will be declared the winners. For example, if the final ends 1-1 on 90 minutes and Roma is the only team to score in extra-time, they will lift the trophy and vice versa.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"\"><b>What happens if the final is still tied after extra-time?
